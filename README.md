# web-crawler-test
A web crawler for a tech test. This app uses axios, cheerio, graphql-yoga and type-graphql to create a very simple web crawler under time constraints.

Use `yarn install` to get the packages needed and than `yarn start` to get the graphql application running locally and navigate to localhost:4000 to start giving queries

Use `yann test` to run the tests and have a quick overview of the basic logic
